		<div class="modal-body">
			<p>We have had a vibrant and energized first trimester: our goals and mission have been revised and are now on the website. Our school is refreshed with new paint and a staff eager to push towards improvement across the school. Our academic results remain strong, especially in the upper grades British curriculum where we continue to comfortably exceed international standards.</p>
			<p>Our teams have worked hard to ensure learning for all students is optimized in our classrooms. Opportunities for student leadership and extension of curriculum skills outside the classroom have been provided, together with a focus on building creativity and participation across the school.</p>
			<p>We are fortunate in having a hard-working student body, proud to be a part of the Al Dhafra family.  Our teachers are committed and loyal and our parents are aspirational and supportive.</p>
			<p>We are looking forward to our second trimester with optimism and a clear direction of moving from strength to strength.</p>
