	<p><img class="tgc float-l" src="<?php echo base_url('img/layout/glee-club-01.jpg') ?>">The Glee club kicked off on January 4th, 2011 in Al Dhafra School, combining musical creativity with vocal excellence. The Glee club was established to allow talented students to express themselves and improve their talents inside a school environment, which would sub sequentially allow them to become more equipped for any talent shows or school functions, whether inside or outside the school premises.</p>

	<p>The sole idea of the club is to improve the talents of those who are already gifted, however it has improved to cover other aspects such as writing lyrics, playing music, and creating choreographies and dance routines for musical shows.</p>

	<p>The club conducts weekly meetings between members for a minimum of an hour; which should help students not lose concentration on their academic progress. The club may conduct other meetings during weekends or after school sessions for enhanced rehearsals before school shows or functions.</p>

	<p>Hoping to extend its vision into inspiring fellow students, the club is planning to have weekly functions during the morning assembly to make the school students refreshed and revitalized early on for a good school day.</p>
