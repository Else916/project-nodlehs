I trust that you had a happy break with your families and friends. The heat is starting to drop and this makes a big difference to the comfort of our students and teachers in school.<br>I am enjoying meeting you outside in the mornings as you drop off your children and thanks for making the effort to be on time. It is delightful to be in my second year so that I can recognize friends from last year and re-connect with them, as well as meeting new faces. Your support for our school is very important as we move from GOOD TO GREAT and we proud to have such a highly educated and committed group of parents to help on our journey of improvement.<br>Some books and uniforms are held up in transit but I appreciate your efforts to adapt; teaching is continuing as per the curriculum schedule and that is the most important thing.<br>I have been around each of our six assemblies which are held each morning in school and the students are all very glad to be back and are singing the UAE anthem in full voice. Our Head Boy and Head Girl â€“ Ghiath Ayman Jabrah and Fatima Al Kaabi -  will receive their badges this week at morning assembly; I congratulate them and their parents for their achievement and wish them well as the ambassadors of our school.<br>The final calendar of activities for the trimester is nearing completion and it will be uploaded for you in the next week.<br>

            <br>Margaret Beresford</p>
