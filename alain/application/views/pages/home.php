I trust that everyone has had a restful break with loved ones and that our students are ready for the year ahead. All classes in the school are full and teachers are prepared for making every lesson count in their teaching program. Our results from IGCSE and A levels have just arrived and look very good indeed. Congratulations to all Cambridge students.<br>Warmest wishes to all in Dhafraâ€™s family as we journey together towards the very best for our students.
            <br>Margaret Beresford</p>
