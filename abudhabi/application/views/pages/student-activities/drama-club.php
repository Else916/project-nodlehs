<br>
<p>Drama and music have come under pressure due to the increasing emphasis on academics, yet they are vital if children are to develop. Al Dhafra Private Schools has a real commitment to these areas. In addition, we believe that Drama and music are important because they stress co- operation and sharing. They are also good for the childâ€™s mental fitness, and can help to build self-discipline. Details of activities will be provided at a later date.</p>
