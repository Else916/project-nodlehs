<h3 class="title"><span>School Mathematics Rigorous Treatment (SMART) Program</span></h3>
<br>
	<p>This is the fifth successful year that we are implementing this mathematical programme which was applied for all the students who have willingly participated in it, for levels K.G2 – Grade 4 throughout the whole academic year. It was conducted by the Primary Math Department. It is a complete program parallel to the school’s curriculum and has five levels for each grade. This unique program provides more academic attention to students with different abilities, whether lower or higher than average students. Pupils with weak prior knowledge also gain much from the SMART program.</p>

	<p>At the end of each level completed by a student, he/she receives a certificate along with a symbolic gift as a way for encouragement. At the end of the year, trophies are awarded to the top achievers in this program.</p>

	<p>Moreover, students from senior classes volunteer to help running this program under the supervision of the teachers.</p>

	<p>It is also worth mentioning that our school was named the best school in coordinating SMART throughout the whole country.</p>
