<h4><u><b>PURPOSE</b></u></h4>
<p>In order to align with the school's mission and vision, values and beliefs, a late policy has been developed to ensure students' uninterrupted progress and to enable children to meet and grow their learning potential.</p>

<p>It is taken into consideration that traffic can be bad and that parents have more than one child to drop off each day.  It is also taken into consideration that tires go flat, shoes get lost, car keys get misplaced and alarms don’t always go off.  However, NONE of these reasons are “legal” reasons for tardiness, so <b>tardy students resulting from such will remain unexcused</b>.   Please plan ahead and allow extra time for unexpected delays as excessive tardiness will lead to poor student performance, low morale and a lack of responsibility. Eventually disciplinary action will need to be implemented.</p>

<p>Parents cannot excuse first period tardiness unless it is for a legal absence reason (illness, medical/dental, religious holiday or funeral). All other reasons will remain unexcused.  There is a misconception that students are not tardy until 7:45.</p>
<p><b>Please note that school starts at 7:30am</b>. Students are expected to prepare themselves and attend assembly where the UAE National Anthem is played, student performances are conducted and information is cascaded.</p>
<p>Students must be in class by 7:40 ready to start the lesson.  If students are not in their classes by <b>7:40</b> when the bell rings, they are considered tardy. Please note the importance of the morning assembly as well as being on time for their first lesson.</p>

<p>Tardiness interrupts the classroom environment and interferes with the learning of other students.</p>

<p>Kindly note that the school gate where students are dropped off and picked up will be closed at 7:35. Only KG students will be admitted after 7:35.  Students arriving after 7:35 must stop at the main reception, obtain a <b>“Late Slip”</b> and hand it to their respective supervisor before going into class.</p>
