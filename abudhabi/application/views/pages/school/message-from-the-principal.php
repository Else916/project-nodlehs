		<h3 class="skin-1">Message from the Principal</h3>

							<p>Dear Students and Parents,</p>

							<p><img src="http://abu-dhabi.dhafraschools.com/images/misc/MrD.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="161" height="150" style="margin:5px;">Welcome to our new and exciting school year! It is my honor and I am very privileged to be your principal. It is my goal to lead our school “from strength to strength” by ensuring that you are provided with high quality education across the curriculum and a strong partnership exists amongst our school, students and parents. At Al Dhafra, our students’ progress and achievement are placed at the center of all we set out to do and all we do. We provide a trusting and supportive school community, in which students are placed at the center of learning, developing personal responsibility and self-discipline as they become independent and creative learners and thinkers. Our teaching is inspiring and all students are empowered to succeed within an innovative culture of high expectations, high standards, and outstanding quality. We are proud of Al Dhafra’s rich history of ensuring that the local as well as regional cultures and traditions are honored and fostered. We ensure that students are safe and provided opportunities to become internationally-minded, global citizens, possessing the skills and character to thrive in a challenging and changing world. </p>

							<p>As we embark on our journey this year there are quite a few events to note. Most noteworthy, it has been two years since our last inspection and we are scheduled to be inspected in term 1. This is a prime opportunity for us to be evaluated by external professionals, show our progress to date and identify key areas for further improvement. I am very confident that our students will shine and our staff will deliver high quality learning opportunities. </p>

							<p>In addition to our inspection, there have some been some key appointments to add to our leadership team, as well as new teachers whom our students will meet on day one. Our ‘Open House’ is scheduled on 29 September 2016, which will provide parents the opportunity to view their child’s learning environment, meet and greet teachers as well as the school’s leadership. We also will be increasing the available extra-curricular activities on offer to our students to further enhance the educational experience of our students. Kindly refer to our school calendar and announcements on the “d6” app for bespoke, up to date information. </p>

							<p>In closing, I would like to thank and recognize our incredible teaching and non-teaching staff who are the ‘unsung heroes’ of our great school, acknowledge the vision, expertise and support of our Chairman, CEO and Board of Directors and, most importantly, pledge to our students and parents that we will continue to provide high quality education and activities for all our students. </p>

							<p><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
							<p><b>Mr. Daniel Bokelman</b></p>
