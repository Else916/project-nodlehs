	<h3>School's Code of Conduct</h3>

	<p>A school is a place that promotes and fosters responsibility, respect, as well as academic and social excellence in a safe teaching and learning environment.</p>

	<p>All stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, staff and community members) have the right to be and feel safe in their school community. With this right comes the responsibility to be conscientious, honorable citizens and to be accountable for one’s actions.</p>

	<p><b>Standards of Behavior:</b> The ABCs for operational conduct, therefore, all school members are expected and encouraged to:</p>
