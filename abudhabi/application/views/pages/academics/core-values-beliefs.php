	<h3 class="title"><span>Core Values / Beliefs</span></h3>
	<br>
							<p>The following are the values we hold which form the foundation on which we perform work and conduct ourselves. They are the practices we use every day in everything we do:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Respect</b></li>
								<li><b>Integrity</b></li>
								<li><b>Achievement</b></li>
								<li><b>Fairness</b></li>
								<li><b>Care</b></li>
								<li><b>Team Work</b></li>
							</ul>

							<h4 class="sub-title">Our Principles of Good Practice that are derived from the core values:</h4>

							<ol>
								<li>Learning is enhanced when it is more like a team effort than a solo race. Good learning, like good work, is collaborative and social, not competitive and isolated. Working with others often increases involvement in learning. Sharing one’s own ideas and responding to others’ reactions improves thinking and deepens understanding.</li>
								<li>Students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.</li>
								<li>Knowing what you know and don’t know focuses learning. Students need appropriate feedback on performance. In getting started, students need help in assessing existing knowledge and competence. In classes, students need frequent opportunities to perform and receive suggestions for improvement. At various points students need chances to reflect on what they have learned, what they still need to know, and how to assess themselves.</li>
								<li>Time plus energy equals learning. There is no substitute for time on task. Learning to use one’s time well is critical for students and professionals alike. Students need help in learning effective time management. Allocating realistic amounts of time means effective learning for students and effective teaching for teachers.</li>
								<li>High expectations are important for everyone—for the poorly prepared, for those unwilling to exert themselves, and for the bright and well motivated. Expecting students to perform well becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when teachers hold high expectations for them and make extra efforts.</li>
								<li>There are many roads to learning. Students bring different talents and styles of learning. Students rich in hands-on experiences may not do so well with theory. Students need the opportunity to show their talents and learn in ways that work for them. They can be pushed to learning in new ways that do not come so easily.</li>
							</ol>
