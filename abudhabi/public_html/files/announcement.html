				<p>Dear Parents,</P>
					<p>To prevent the outbreak of head lice in the school, we will be arranging head lice inspection of students starting from from this week and every term. The school is aware that this can be a sensitive issue and is committed to maintain student’s confidentiality to avoid stigmatisation.</p>

					<p>Before any inspections are conducted the nurse will explain to all students the importance of personal hygiene such as grooming, cleanliness of the teeth, hair, nails etc.</p>

					<p>Please note that health regulations requires, when a student is found with head lice, he/she should not return to school until he/she is free from head lice. However, if the student has nits (eggs), the student can continue school provided that he/ she should be free from it within 2-3 days.</p>

					<p>The school may request the parent/ guardian for the completion of an ‘action taken form’. This form will be given by the school clinic to the concerned student.</p>
